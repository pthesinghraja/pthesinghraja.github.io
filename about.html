				<h2>PREETHI THESINGHRAJA</h2>
<p>
To the World, I'm Preethi Thesinghraja. Yes, that’s right THE-SINGH-RAJAAAA.
I’m a person inspired by every single thought that occurs in my mind and puts
it into action. I have gained experience in various fields such as Corporate
Social Responsibility, Teaching, Public Relations, News Production,
Advertising, Web Marketing, Book Writing & Researching, Database Management and
last but not the least my current role as a Data Analyst. 
<br>
<br>

There is always a small part of me that pulls me into teaching for the little
kids. So someday you will see this Data Analyst to resign as a CEO of a company
and grow into teaching. 
<br>
<br>

So, now going little bit into my origin. I was born in a small town (Small
town, really???) named ‘Madurai’. I have a sister who had the opportunity to
explore the world and spend an extra 3 years with my parents. Her name rhymes
well with mine. She is Aarthy Thesinghraja. Yes, again THE-SIGNH-RAJA. My
parents both were into banking that gave us a chance to travel north J My Dad
is so much into travel that every year, he had to take us for a trip. Having
said that, I have pretty much travelled every state in India except for the
western most part of India.
<br>
<br>

Even though having a pure Multimedia knowledge, I jumped into IT and started my
career with Accenture as an Asst. Software Developer and eventually got
promoted as a Software Developer Analysts. And just when my life was getting
little boring and monotonous, my sister thought I should be abroad and get some
little more background on the Analytics Stuff (Oh yeah! She was already doing
her Masters in US). And She did everything to bring me here, pushed me enough
to give my GRE and what not. So did my boyfriend (Oops sorry, didn’t mention it
above, yes I have a boy Friend, who pretty much lives in his own world most of
the time, oh Noooooo! I’m not being a TYPICAL girlfriend here). Both of them
just wanted me out of India and motivated me enough to get here. And I wanted
to come here as well for the first and obvious reason is to travel. (C’mon why
not, such a beautiful place it is). 
<br>
<br>

I will make use of this website with two fragments, one would be to share all
my projects and the other one would be to share my experiences and thoughts.
